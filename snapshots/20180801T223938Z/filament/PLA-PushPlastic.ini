Possibly turn on only for PETG.\n\nRe: head temp\nWas using 205C, then 200C showed less stringing.  Now testing 195C to see if it helps make my bridges less droopy.\n\nRe: bed temp\n65-70C for first layer sometimes causes pillowing, so trying 60C.  oops just not enough hairspray - going back to 70C for first layer"
