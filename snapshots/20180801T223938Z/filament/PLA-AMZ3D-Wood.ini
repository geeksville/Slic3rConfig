Update: had to go up to 205C to prevent jamming\n\nMeasured extrusion multiplier is 0.83, but subtract 4% to prevent slight over extrusion seen at corners of test cube or in long thin areas of 100% infill.\n\nAlternative approach: \ncurrent extrusion multiplier * 0.4 /  measured width of .4 mm wall cube = new extrusion multiplier\n( It is important to make sure the top layer is not extra wide due to other settings)\n\n\nStale: use 0.88 for accurate thin walls, down to 0.80ish to prevent over extrusion.  If using such a low extrusion mult, then for first layer increase extrusion to 175%.\n\nRe: bed temp\n...\n\nRe: fan\nKeep always on to help with bridging"
