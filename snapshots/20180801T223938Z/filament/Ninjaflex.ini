If using such a low extrusion mult, then for first layer increase extrusion to 175%.\n\nRe: cooling settings\nTurn off 'fan always on' because that slightly screws up adhesion.  Possibly turn on only for PETG.\n\nRe: head temp\nUsing 210C always to keep pressure low for TPU.\n\nRe: bed temp\nusing 75C for first layer to improve adhestion for TPU\n\nvolumetric speed:\nusing 2.5 mm3/sec for tpu - very low, but it slows down the print as needed"
