notes = Note: Customized from standard by using a 0.26 layer height (supposedly less jamming), turn off thin wall detection so test cube prints perfect (we don't care about dimensionality on woodfill)\n\nPick an infill minimum 20% if it needs to support upper layers, pick an infill of 40% for maximum strength.\n\nRunning infill at 100 mm/sec is too fast when printing coolish (190C PLA), lowered to 80 to prevent extruder clicking\n\nperemiter speed at 70 still shows ringing. alas - I give up for now.\n\ninfill: experimenting with 45% infill/peremeter overlap instead of default of 56% because of my problem with over extrusion on 1mm thick walls. 15% was too low/caused no infill, 40% was almost enough - got 0.95mm walls where it should be 1mm, 45% was too low also. 48% seems _slightly_ under 0.97mm, but I don't want to go higher and risk over extruding.\n\nsupports: \nusing 0.22mm vertical separation rather than 0.2 to make a little less sticky in Z\nusing a horizontal distance of 85% now, because 80% was still a little too sticky\n\nretraction:\ndon't use too much retraction or you can jam e3d extruders (never more than 2mm - e3d says no need for more than 1mm).  currently 0.7mm, though 0.6mm was _almost_ perfect it had a small amount of hairs.\n\nI'm currently using z hop off, was using 0.2mm but heard it can lead to bumps like I see on the test cube thin walls.  Tests confirmed that less blobs with it off.\n\nextrusion:\nI'm using 150% extrusion width for first layer rather than default of 200% because my auto level bed seems to do pretty good!  Though 150% was too low to still get perfect 1st layers near edge of bed.  165% had a bit of elephant foot\n
