If using such a low extrusion mult, then for first layer increase extrusion to 175%.\n\nRe: cooling settings\nTurn off 'fan always on' because that slightly screws up adhesion.  Possibly turn on only for PETG.\n\nRe: head temp\nWas using 205C, testing 200C to see if less stringing.\n\nRe: bed temp\n65-70C for first layer sometimes causes pillowing, so trying 60C.  oops just not enough hairspray - going back to 70C for first layer"
