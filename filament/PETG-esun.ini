At 240 I'd get the extruder clicking sometimes.  Trying 235 one more time...\n\nMeasured extrusion multiplier is 0.88, tried 4% less because of prior over extrusion with PLA (10% decrease was too much, 5% was also too much).  Now trying only 2% less because the translucent PETG showed voitds better.\n\na bit of elephants foot, just lowered bed temps by 5 degree from 90/85.  To help with pillowing problem, lowered bed temp to 75 deg.   I tried keep fans on at 100% after 2nd layer, but that actually made things worse (though bridge layers were better) because the fan would cause the top layer to harden too fast and lift up from the layer beneath.\n\naccording to e3d forums max volumetric speed on a e3dv6 is 15mm^3/sec\n"
